# TODO: Security Audit and Fixes

## Critical Security Issues Found

### 1. Hardcoded Passwords in Seeders
- [x] `database/seeders/CompleteTestDataSeeder.php` - Fixed: Uses secure passwords and removed password display
- [x] `database/seeders/ResetAccountsSeeder.php` - Fixed: Uses secure passwords
- [x] `database/seeders/RolesAndPermissionsSeeder.php` - Fixed: Uses secure passwords and removed password display
- [x] `database/seeders/UsersWithRolesSeeder.php` - Fixed: Uses secure passwords
- [x] `database/factories/UserFactory.php` - Fixed: Uses secure temporary password

### 2. Hardcoded Passwords in API Documentation
- [x] `postman_api_guide_complete.md` - Fixed: Replaced hardcoded passwords with placeholders
- [x] `postman_api_complete.md` - Fixed: Replaced hardcoded passwords with placeholders
- [x] `api_endpoints_postman_guide_clean.md` - Fixed: Replaced hardcoded passwords with placeholders
- [x] `api_testing_guide_complete.md` - Fixed: Replaced hardcoded passwords with placeholders
- [x] `docs/postman_user_api_examples.md` - Fixed: Replaced hardcoded passwords with placeholders

### 3. Password Hashing Issues
- [ ] Check if all password hashing uses `Hash::make()` consistently
- [ ] Verify password reset functionality uses proper hashing
- [ ] Ensure no plain text passwords are stored anywhere

### 4. Input Validation and Sanitization
- [ ] Review all form requests for proper validation rules
- [ ] Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities in raw queries
- [ ] Verify XSS protection in all user inputs

### 5. File Upload Security
- [ ] Check file upload handlers for proper validation
- [ ] Ensure uploaded files are stored securely
- [ ] Verify file type and size restrictions

### 6. Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Review middleware implementation
- [ ] Check for proper role-based access control
- [ ] Verify CSRF protection is enabled everywhere

## Security Improvements Needed

### Environment and Configuration
- [ ] Ensure .env.example doesn't contain sensitive defaults
- [ ] Check for hardcoded API keys or secrets in config files
- [ ] Verify proper encryption key configuration

### Database Security
- [ ] Review database migrations for proper constraints
- [ ] Check for sensitive data exposure in queries
- [ ] Ensure proper indexing for performance and security

### API Security
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add proper API authentication
- [ ] Review CORS configuration

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Critical Fixes**
   - Remove hardcoded passwords from seeders
   - Update API documentation to use placeholder passwords
   - Fix any password hashing inconsistencies

2. **Phase 2: Input Validation**
   - Strengthen form request validation
   - Add proper sanitization
   - Implement security headers

3. **Phase 3: File Security**
   - Secure file upload functionality
   - Add file type validation
   - Implement proper storage permissions

4. **Phase 4: Testing**
   - Security testing of all fixes
   - Penetration testing
   - Code review for security issues

## Status
- [x] Security audit completed
- [x] Critical issues identified
- [x] Implementation plan created
- [x] Phase 1: Critical Fixes completed
- [ ] Phase 2: Input Validation in progress
